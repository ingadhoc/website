===========================
ArgentinianÂ Website Sale UX
===========================

This module adds some changes on eCommerce frontend which are listed below:

#. When this module is installed we will find a "(+ tax)" or "(tax included)" text indication next to all prices on the eCommerce (on shop page, product page, and checkout pages). Be advise that the "tax" word is replaced by the real name of the tax applied on the product. Also the "(+ tax)" or "(tax included)" message will be displayed based on the eCommerce's B2B or B2C parameter selected for each website.
#. In case that our eCommerce is set as a B2C one, then on checkout's frontend right side bar (where the purchase summary is displayed) the "Taxes" line is hidden, and the "Taxes" amount is added to the "Subtotal" line.
